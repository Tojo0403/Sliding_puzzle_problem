# Sliding_puzzle_problem

•Implemented a code in C++ to design the 8 puzzle solver with the help of BFS,A* and IDA* graph algorithms


•Designed efficient state-space and heuristics that benifited the algorithms in both memory and time



•We used well known basic heuristics to solve this(Hamming,Manhattan,Linear Conflict)


•Simulated the algorithms on the state -space giving optimal strategic moves leading to the solution state of puzzle



•Also found whether final state can be achieved or not using Inversion Count and devised benchmarks to increase efficiency by comparing the optimality of different algorithms
